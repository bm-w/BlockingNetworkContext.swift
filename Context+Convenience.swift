extension Context {
///	Returns three closures:
///	 -  `cancel`: cancels the request (not guaranteed: cancelation may not be acknowledged until the request is already fully sent, or the response already fully received);
///	 -  `resume`: resumes the request (the request will also resume upon calling `receiveComplete`);
///	 -  `receiveComplete`: blocks, then throws or returns the HTTP response and optional body data.
///
///	Usage:
///
///	    let request: URLRequest = ...
///	    let (cancel, _, receiveComplete) = context.perform(request)
///	    let (response, data) = try! receiveComplete()
///
